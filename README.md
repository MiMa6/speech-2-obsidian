### 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- An OpenAI API key
- Obsidian vault set up on your system
- A working microphone
- (Optional) Access to iPhone Voice Memos on macOS

### 🛠️ Installation

1. Install Obsidian💎:

   - Download and install Obsidian from [https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)
   - Create a new vault or open an existing one
   - Note down your vault path for the configuration

2. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiMa6/speech-2-obsidian.git
cd speech-2-obsidian
```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

4. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=/path/to/your/vault
USER_PATH==/Users/you
MICROPHONE_NAME==your-microphone-name
VOICE_MEMOS_DIR=/path/to/voice/memos  # For iPhone Voice Memos feature
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. Run the script:

```bash
python speech_to_text.py
```

2. Choose your action:

   - Press `1` to start recording
   - Press `2` to quit
   - Press `3` to process existing obsidian audio files
   - Press `4` to process latest iPhone voice memo

## 🎯 How It Works

1. 🎤 **Recording**: Uses your configured microphone to capture audio
2. 🤖 **Transcription**: Sends audio to OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate transcription
3. 🪄 **Grammar & Punctuation Restoration**: Uses OpenAI LLM to add punctuation and paragraph breaks for readability
4. 🏷️ **Theme Extraction**: Uses GPT-4o to identify key themes and add them as hashtags
5. 📝 **Organization**:
   - Transcripts go to `[vault]/Audios/SpeechToText/`
   - Original recordings move to `[vault]/Audios/Translated/`
6. 📱 **Voice Memos**: Finds and processes the latest iPhone voice memo

## 🔧 Configuration

Configuration is managed using Pydantic for robust validation and type safety:

- `Settings`: Environment variables and app settings (in `src/settings.py`)
- `AudioConfig`: Recording settings (silence threshold, duration, etc.)
- `FileConfig`: File naming and directory structures
- `LogConfig`: Logging settings and rotation

All configuration classes use Pydantic's validation to ensure type safety and proper value constraints.

### 📝 Logging

Logs are automatically saved in the `logs/` directory
